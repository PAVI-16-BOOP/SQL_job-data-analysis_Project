For DATA ANALYST 

🔥 Key Observations
📈 Salary Range
Top salary: ₹4,00,000 (for svn)

Lowest among top 25: ~₹1,15,479 (for scala)

Majority of these skills sit comfortably above ₹1,15k–₹1,50k+, which is quite premium for data analyst roles.

🧩 Skill Categories
Looking at the skills, they fall into a few big buckets:

🪄 1. Version Control & DevOps tools
These dominate the high-paying skills — not surprising, because they are critical in collaborative, production-grade data work.

svn (highest!)

gitlab, bitbucket, atlassian

puppet, ansible, terraform

vmware, twilio

These show that knowledge of CI/CD pipelines & deployment tools really pays off.

🔍 2. Programming Languages & Frameworks
Strong programming skills also correlate with higher pay.

golang, scala, perl

solidity (blockchain-related, niche & lucrative)

🤖 3. AI/ML & Deep Learning Frameworks
ML & AI-related skills show up consistently.

mxnet, dplyr (data manipulation), keras, pytorch, tensorflow, hugging face

Deep learning frameworks & NLP tools clearly add value even to a data analyst role.

🔗 4. Big Data & Databases
Handling big data is hot.

cassandra, kafka, couchbase, airflow

Knowledge of distributed systems & streaming tools gets rewarded.

📊 5. Misc/Niche
datarobot — AutoML platform

notion — collaboration/documentation (surprising but suggests orgs value productivity tooling too)

🏓 Summary Table of Trends
🧰 Skill Area	Examples	Trend
DevOps & Deployment	svn, gitlab, puppet, terraform	Most lucrative
Programming & Scripting	golang, scala, perl, solidity	High value esp. niche
ML & AI	keras, pytorch, hugging face, mxnet	Big demand
Big Data & Pipelines	kafka, cassandra, airflow, couchbase	Strong demand
Productivity Tools	notion, twilio, atlassian	Adds bonus value

🥇 Takeaways for You
✅ Learning DevOps + ML + Big Data tools as a data analyst can skyrocket your pay.
✅ Even though these aren’t the traditional “Excel + SQL” analyst tools, companies pay a premium for analysts who can bridge analytics → engineering → ML.
✅ Picking a couple of niche skills (like solidity, hugging face, datarobot) gives you a competitive edge.


For DATA SCIENTIST


📊 Quick Salary Stats:
📈 Highest: ₹2,15,477 → asana

📉 Lowest (of top 25): ₹1,48,714 → atlassian

Most skills here sit in the ₹1.5–2.1L+ range.

Notably, the top salaries for Data Scientists are higher than for Data Analysts — which makes sense given the role complexity.

🧩 Skill Buckets & Trends
🏓 1️⃣ Collaboration & Productivity Tools
➡️ Surprisingly, these are at the top!

asana, airtable, slack, notion, zoom, atlassian

🎯 Companies clearly value data scientists who can integrate seamlessly into cross-functional teams, document & communicate results effectively.

🧠 2️⃣ Niche Programming Languages & Frameworks
➡️ Data Scientists seem to cash in on mastering less-common languages & frameworks.

elixir, lua, objective-c, haskell, ruby on rails

These aren’t your usual Python/R; they’re rare, and niche — which explains the premium.

🤖 3️⃣ AI / ML & NLP Tools
➡️ Still crucial, and higher up than for Data Analysts.

hugging face, theano, watson, rshiny, dplyr

Watson & Hugging Face especially highlight NLP skills.

🔗 4️⃣ Big Data & Databases
➡️ Handling complex, large-scale data still pays.

neo4j (graph db), dynamodb, bigquery, airflow

Note that graph databases (Neo4j) & cloud data warehouses (BigQuery) feature here — showing how Data Scientists are expected to model more complex relationships.

🕹️ 5️⃣ Game & Simulation Engines
➡️ This is unique to Data Scientists in this list!

unity, unreal

This suggests roles in simulation, AR/VR analytics, gaming analytics — cutting-edge domains.

🚀 6️⃣ DevOps & Cloud (lightly represented)
redhat, codecommit

Compared to Data Analysts, Data Scientists need these less but it still shows up.

👀 How does this differ from the Data Analyst list?
Theme	Data Analyst	Data Scientist
Top Skills	DevOps & CI/CD heavy (SVN, Puppet)	Collaboration & niche languages
ML/DL Tools	More general (TensorFlow, PyTorch)	More NLP-heavy (HuggingFace, Watson)
Programming	More mainstream + scripting	Rare/niche programming languages
Big Data	Streaming & distributed (Kafka)	Graph & cloud DBs (Neo4j, BigQuery)
Game Engines	🟥 Not present	🟩 Present
Collaboration Tools	Lower priority	High priority (Asana, Airtable)

🏆  Summary:
✅ For Data Scientists, collaboration + niche expertise = big bucks.
✅ Mastering rare programming paradigms (functional programming, graph dbs, NLP frameworks) gives a clear edge.
✅ Skills like unity, unreal, and hugging face hint at growing roles in AI-driven creative industries.
✅ Data Scientists are expected to tackle harder modeling & communication challenges, which explains the emphasis on both technical depth and teamwork tools.
